# Code Refactor Starter Code
Challenge 1: Git challenge: Code Refractor

Below are some changes that were done to better organize the coding for accessibiltiy purposes and for the developer to read the code easier.
________________
Title in header:
Change file name & HTML title to "horiseon" for better accessibility.

________________
Comments on Code for better organization:
Added HTML & CSS comments before each element or section on the page. Example shown below:
<img scr="./assets/readme_imgs/include-comments-css.png" alt="code"/>
<img scr="./assets/readme_imgs/include-comments-html.png" alt="code"/>

________________
Header:
Used nav element for the top navagation.

________________
Hero:
Add an id to "search-engine-optimization" in order for the "Search Engine Optimization" button to work on the nav bar.

Use section element instead of div and article instead of div, to describe the 3 articles in the hero section.

Remove "</img>". The img tab does not need a closing like this. It only requires this closing />
Use alt description for photos.

________________
Sidebar:
Add alt="" to the img tag to skip over the .png file for accessibility purposes.

________________
Summary:
Eliminated extra unessesary CSS styles, and combined styles that were related for clear code base.
